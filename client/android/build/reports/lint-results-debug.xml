    <issue
        id="DataExtractionRules"
        severity="Warning"
        message="The attribute `android:fullBackupContent` is deprecated from Android 12 and higher and may be removed in future versions. Consider adding the attribute `android:dataExtractionRules` specifying an `@xml` resource which configures cloud backups and device transfers on Android 12 and higher."
        category="Security"
        priority="3"
        summary="Missing data extraction rules"
        explanation="Before Android 12, the attributes `android:allowBackup` and `android:fullBackupContent` were used to configure all forms of backup, including cloud backups, device-to-device transfers and adb backup.&#xA;&#xA;In Android 12 and higher, these attributes have been deprecated and will only apply to cloud backups. You should instead use the attribute `android:dataExtractionRules`, specifying an `@xml` resource that configures which files to back up, for cloud backups and for device-to-device transfers, separately. If your `minSdkVersion` supports older versions, you&apos;ll still want to specify an `android:fullBackupContent` resource if the default behavior is not right for your app."

        summary="Monochrome icon is not defined"
        explanation="If `android:roundIcon` and `android:icon` are both in your manifest, you must either remove the reference to `android:roundIcon` if it is not needed; or, supply the monochrome icon in the drawable defined by the `android:roundIcon` and `android:icon` attribute.&#xA;&#xA;For example, if `android:roundIcon` and `android:icon` are both in the manifest, a launcher might choose to use `android:roundIcon` over `android:icon` to display the adaptive app icon. Therefore, your themed application iconwill not show if your monochrome attribute is not also specified in `android:roundIcon`."
